# World Generation
 2D Top down world generation (Sandbox) that written in Game Maker (Game Maker Studio 2.3). Uses arrays and structs (lightweight objects) to implement world and cells (tiles), and surfaces to draw things (lighting/tiles).
 Written just for nothing, use as you want!
To do later:
 - Make optimizations.
 - Make UI and controlling of the settings in the game itself.
 - Make some simulations like city grow and other.
