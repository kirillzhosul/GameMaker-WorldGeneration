# Game Maker World Generation
 World generation written in game maker (Game Maker Studio 2.3). Uses array, structs (lightweight objects) to generate world and implement cells, and surface to draw lighting above.
 Written just for nothing, use as you want!
 May do later:
 - Some other cool simulations.
